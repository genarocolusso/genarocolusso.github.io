       <h4>League of Dates </h4>

       <p>Using PHP, CSS, HTML, JQuery, AJAX and MySQL. I was able to create an web application to find people interested in League of Legends around Brazil. It had an UI similar to Tinder, where the user could choose to like or dislike a Player based on his Picture, Description and Ranked Level. It was integrated with League of Legends API, so the player had to validate his account to register, after that all his public game data like Level, Rank, Avatar and nickname were able to be used to fill an database. If both users like each other then they could see their nicknames so they could add the other player inside the game.</p>
       <p> It had over 25000  users in about 2 months . </p>
